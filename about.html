            The demonetization of November 2016 was arguably the major catalyst
            in digitizing India. The estimated value of mobile wallet
            transactions in 2020 across India was 36.5 trillion Indian rupees.
            This was expected to more than triple by 2024. Rising smartphone
            penetration along with increasing competition in the domestic market
            could be attributed to the growing value. The value of card payments
            in India for the fiscal year 2020 amounted to approximately 15
            trillion Indian rupees. This was after a consistent increase in card
            payments since fiscal year 2014, as a result of the government's
            initiative to digitize the country, catalyzed by the demonetization
            of currency notes in November 2016. Despite all these milestone
            achievements Cash is still king in India. Our mission is to empower
            people toward digital transactions thereby the idea of digital india
            can come to reality.

            in digital payments in India. At the same time, the threat landscape
            has mushroomed too. Nearly half of Indian consumers(47%) are more
            worried about frauds while making digital transactions amid the
            coronavirus crisis, shows a study. About 28 per cent of consumers
            are now exercising more caution while making payments using various
            digital modes, according to a study conducted by YouGov and ACI
            Worldwide, a real-time electronic payment and banking solutions
